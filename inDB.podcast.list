- bsd	NO

Too long, too waffly, too far from my interests. Well, its not, but this is not worth 1/7th of every week's podcast time, and they should know that. 

- revolutions	NO

OK, it's very well done and about important subjects. However, for me, I would rathre read a book when I became interested in a particular revolution. Maybe I should be interested - how did all these revolutions actually happen - but I'm not. 

- revisionist history	YES

Really knocked off my chair by the first one, mildly tickled by the remainder. Each is "another look" at a recent (last 10 years) event that has escaped the public mind. Weirdly professional and very well done. 


- techdirt	YES

Seriously done with good, interesting subjects. 

- Reason Podcast	NO

This is a news commentary: what do *we* say about this week's events? It is well done considering that it doesn't use experts and the contributors are obviously well prepared. However is isi not very initeresting and the choice of subjects is poor. 

- HBR cast	YES, MAYBE

Listened to two and they were both... very corporate business, very well made, very... HBR. 

- intercepted	MAYBE

From the intercept. Passablle overviews or interviews of current affairs. One time is was a smart-crack commedian which was stupid. Maybe they are still finding their audience.


- speaking in tech	MAYBE

OK, long & boring product reviews but good news and commentary. Between stackoverflow and cisco. 

- Soverign Man	MAYBE

Well spoken, deep & current economic issues & human independence. He tends to repeat everything exactly twice, except when he forgets and repeats three times.  He didn't know that bonds pay coupouns, he thought that a bond's yeild can be known when it's brought and he didn't know that Winston Churchill had won the Nobel Prize. 

- Carnige	YES

serious, well done, expert panel, important subjects. 

- intelligence squared	get more

interesting, one expert-ish talker

- intellegence squared debates	NO

OK, important subjects talked trhought and overton windows established. However, this has adverts, four or six of them fucking hell, and waiy way way too much filler. The main benefit of this podcast is that it shows that some, not all but some, expoerts are complete idiots or fundamentally dishonest; there seems to be one such on each debate. And the audience applauds on queue regardless. 

- Foreign Affairs Unedited	YES

Many experts, edited. Very good and very focused. Suprizingly good, professional. This could be a good demonstration to others. 

- Chips w Everything (Guardian)	YES

well made but not super deep. A bit much advert-like filler. 

- HigherSide	NO

Awful songs, vague & unfocused interviews with lots of filler. Apparently this is about THC / marijuana

- Security Mgmt Highlights	YES

Short (20 minutes), lots of different stuff and weirdly professional. Good on them. 

- David Ikle	YES

It's OK, interesting ideas. Short so why not? Uses claims that I have not had demostrated, but what do I know. 

- Federalist Radio Hour	YES

(1) Very serious, high quality, American (?) focused discussion amongst, it seems, experts "... in my book... ". Related to Intelligence Squared. 
(2) kinda silly: the US Army is powerfuls because of the 19th Century attitudes of its officers, not because of vast, vast spending on it.  Also, plitically difficult evidences, like Sara Palin's 'baby's parentage, are ignorde. 
(3) openly conservative, which is weirdly interesting will making it good to see the other side. 

- Nasa Weekly	YES

very very short, so why not. a news show. Kinda interesting, but seems to contain good background info too: just what kind of things, in general, are going on. Meaty-ish. 

- a16z	YES

Just a great podcast. Always interesting, always disciplined and full of info. Hence its great reputation. 

- American Dissent (?) voices	YES

Interesting anti-Jewish (not anti zionist, anti jewish) rant. I disagreed with some of the things that he said, but worthwhile regardless. 

- Packet Pushers	YES

Professional, like the Cisco podcasts, but covering general networking. A good podcast. 

- Tech Talk	YES

Event though they are not experts, this is very well done. They are all very knowledgeable and obviously read-up on each show's subject. Overall disciplined and full of information. 

- Motherboard/Vice	NO

Important subjects but poorly done, really... so much like Vice magazine! Needs an editor and suprizingly amateur. 

- plusplus podcast	MAYBE

A second attempt by Vice to make a podcast. Much more professional and focusing on one worthy subject each 'episode'. Somehow didn't grab me. The information rate has to be kept up, else it doesn't work. Interesting as an example of podcast as mini doco. 

- Late Night Linux	MAYBE

Four skilled non-specialists.... but it's OK. However, as with all non-experts, when it get's down to it, they don't actually know the core, inner details of their subjects. Why oh why don't podcasts like this use experts, a different one each week? Many would be glad. This is too long and should be edited, both for length and to remove filler. 

Summary: It's interesting, over waffly, and without experts. 

- Mysterious Universe	NO

The presenters are kinda charlies with weird Australian accents. The show is disorganised and largely comprised of filler. Badness. 

- september clues	NO

unbeliveably waffly, lots of irrelevant filler, generally unfocused on anything. Two young guys talking about, really, nothing. Note that they claim that **satellites** that they can see for themselves, are, actually, faked. And not just once, either, on multiple shows as a recurring them. One is a lawyer....

Is it possible that this is purposely retarded? Who knows? 

- Steal This Show	MAYBE (only listened to one)

A bit disorganized and too long, but they really get down to interesting subjects. Again (1) edit - over one hour is too lonog, and  (2) get a (real) expert on each episode. 

- The Economist	YES

Short, very short. Completly professional, focused... and not ludicrious! These are news, so keep it recent. 

- Anacast	MAYBE

While it is just a guy and maybe another guy (always, it seems) rambling, these are people who have successfully left the grid. Freedom

- Vin Apniani show (not activist post)	NO

Great subjects, but it's just a guy talking & half waffling at that. No experts: only punters. If he/they were prepared, if this was compressed and edited, if they always got experts, then it could be GREAT. But it's not, so it's not. 

- Open Souce Security	NO

Interesting, yes, but tooooo long winded, too much filler, no experts. After 10 minutes it's just too much.  No I DO NOT what to hear what you did last night. No, it DOES NOT build repore. Beyond that, too waffly and needs to be edited.  

- 20 Minute VC	MAYBE

Good: successful people talking about their remarkable success.
Good: very well done
Bad: there are fucking adverts, two of them. 
If I was an entreprenur then this would be right on. I'm not, so it's too far from my interests. 

- Jay's analysis	NO? MAYBE? ... NO 

One episode was two undiciplined guys talking about a Carrol Quigly book, turning the pages to get ideas. Pointless. One episode he snivled the whole (?) way through "Oh, sorry", so I skipped it. On one show, the Green Movement was "Marxist" because Marx talked about nature (really); on another the superbowl was "the most watched TV program ever" (the USA's 'We are the world' stupidity) and of course it's not (it has been in some years the most watched annual sporting event, but that's in the past)

- foreign Policy	NO

This is Fox News for suits (c.f. rednecks). Talks of "Iran's aggressive actions in the region" and Russia's "irresponsibility" operating in close proximity to the USA in Syria. Suprizingly little insight, only platitudes from the media. A poor showing. eg "We could be dragged ("drug") into a Japan China conflict" so the USA as passive, innocent victim, followed by the very next sentence directly supporting active USA interventionism.  It's just a mess. I'd expect more from open minded university students. 

- great escape	Maybe

About living outside the system. Their travel writing podcast was great. Serious, worthy, enjoyable. However, too much a promotion for itself, the company behind the podcast, c.f. the almost independent Cisco podcast. 

- cisco, TACSecurity	MAYBE

THIS is how to do a corporate podcast. Focus on the topics, be clear about what you are doing, talk about your products, make it serious. However, too far from my interests. 

- writers market	MAYBE

This should be edited. They think they have to fill up an hour - create some content - but this cut down to 30 minutes of the worthwhile content would be great. They need to respect their listeners' time. 

- all independent writers	NO

Well meaning but too sparse, too irrelevant and full of radio DJ like giggling. 

- talk nerdy	NO

Just two girls rambling in a generally uniformed manner about vaguely techy shit "yes, I think so, <giggle>" type thing. Avoid.

- adam ruins everything	MAYBE

Skip the first 2 minutes. After that it's ok, a bit charlie but passable. Had an interesting interview with Bruce Schneier. 

- conversion cast	YES

So far one super intere$ting interview, and professional. Focused, practical, with experts and very short: an example podcast. Another was excellent too. 

- Christianity's Darkest Secrets	NO

Terrible, terrible sound quality.  Terrible terrible presentation and, I kid you not, long bible readings. Legalize Hemp warriors discussing drug references in the old testament. This HAS to be one of the worst podcasts ever. Maybe it's not a podcast and just got mixed up with mine. Anyway, it's the worst. 

- grammar girl	NO

Not really that much to do with grammar, often 'interesting word facts' AND bad adverts. In a 20 minute podcast, 3, maybe 4 minutes are ads. It just doesn't add up. Solution: 1. get a sponsor (no adverts)  2. actually talk about grammar. And she "has been inducted into the podcasting hall of fame": multidimensional multifuck. 

- mortified	NO

maybe interesting but, really, the most interesting thing about this podcast is how uninteresting its subjects are. How can that be?  Talks of somewhat scary historical incidents. 

- cutting through the matrix	NO

One guy rambling. No special knowledge and I couldn't force myself to listen to an hour of it. This is a good example of how not to make a podcast. 

- data stories	YES

interesting, very interesting topics. The interviewers should think through their questions better, though. A practical version of Data Sceptic. 

- better freelancing	NO

Too much about the host, and generally undisciplined. They need to respect their listeners' time more. No, I don't want to know what shit happened to the host today, or to his daughter. Did you know that "oh ha ha ha. Waffle" comes across as just stupidity to an informed listener?

- cpp casts	MAYBE

Actually pretty interesting and pretty well done. A real testement to what 'just doing it' can achieve. However... it is a bit too far outside my personal interest zone. some tech/obscure podcasts also catch the regular listener by integrating their specific details with deeper ideas and using their subjects as example of deeper issues. Cpp Casts does not. 

- triangulation	NO

Too waffly, interesting subjects by can't listen to all of a podcast. When the presenter waffles, the podcast sounds stupid. As with other podcasts, no, I don't want to know what your daughter argued with her friend about and, no, that is not a good demonstration of X. 

- whatreallyhappened "podcast"	NO

Not a podcast but just a radio - talk back radio - show, complete with awful adverts, shallow callers, no in-depth on any subject, attitude over content. A hugely wasted oppourtunity for such an institution as WWH. 
Should be: 
1. pick a few underlying themes from the week 
2. talk about those underlying themes w reference to the information items available,
3. have a different REAL expert each week calling/skyping in.  
But it isn't like that, and it's awful. 

- Last Podcast On the Left	NO

Fuck, a bunch of DJ jocks cracking jokes and being school-boy smart-arses. And, this is on super interesting subjects, too, (e.g. the details of the Roswell "weather balloon" incident, from the various books on the subject). But it's self-obsessed dumb fucks from the local radio station. It's awful: avoid.  

- disinfo Wars	YES

It's a news show, it's about the now, so get the recent ones. Ground-breaking and famous and rightly so. For a good life listen regularly. 

- Dangerous History	MAYBE

Obviously a clever and well read guy. Howeveeer, he's too vague, too "oh, yes, and I just thought of this ..." Good content but tiring to listen to. I actually gave up on these despite thinking that some of them were super interesting. 

Skip the first 10 minutes of each podcast as it is filler shit. Is this only about the USA? 

- strange matters	NO

In this podcast, "I guess that" means the truth; huge numbers of sightings, evidence, FBI files & otherwise being physically impossible are "tin foil hat...conspiracy theories". This is really the worst of the worst, a stupidocracy podcast. On listening to some more, I just decided that (1) these are not very interesting and (2) the presenters don't really have enquiring minds. This is an internet search made into a podcast - bet *that* seemed like a great idea at the time. 

- expanded perspectives	NO

A radioshow marketed as a podcast.  "Hey John"... "Oh, we don't want to talk about that!" ... "Ha ha ha!" banter. They would have involved themselves in a "conspiracy theory" but "on ho". People "claim" but "the authority' "says". 

- infinite expansion	NO

Only, or even less, that what I already know. Tooo slow, tooo sparse, not dense enough. Alt-news, backgrounders, but weak

- Dev Hell	NO

a couple of guys talking completely uninteresting shit about not much. Each 1 hour show could easily be reduced to 10 minutes, and then it could be great. If something is commedy then it HAS TO be funny, comprehende? 

- altered boy	NO

interesting but nothing that i didn't already know

- the not boring tech writer show	MAYBE

Actually kinda interesting. Some aspect of it is great, it's very 'clean' or clear. Task focused. More about strolling around a topic than really getting down to it, that would be my only criticism. All kinds of stuff. 

- bad voltage	NO

just full of radio-host like laughing banter. It's fucking awful. The last thing I would *ever* want to listen to. There are laugh clips. AVOID. 

- geek news radio	NO

Not as bad as bad voltage.  About the guys themselves (awful) primarially. Oh, so interesting. Real student radio fare.  AVOID. 

- Hacker Punk Radio	NO

Brainlessly slow, vague, unprofessional. Took 5 minutes to describe what grep was.

- The Australian	MAYBE
  
rawville: An audio documentatry. This set of 6 podcasts is very interesting as to how it shows what can be done in this infant genre. A good reference for others wondering what podcasts can be. The other "The Australian" podcasts are serious, meaty journalism.

- astronomy cast	MAYBE

nice idea, as some great ideas. but the delivery is very poor. Again, having two random experts - not specific subject experts - rambling is not enough: there has to be someone who is an expert on specically X talking about X. And the woman has a weird school teacher, nice school teacher, thing going on. The times when there is an outside expert this podcast works; when there isn't, it doesn't. Simple. 

- Curious Minds	NO

Yes: if you are a housewife who shudders at the thought of 'school' or 'classes' or even 'science' but who is still interested in things, this is for you.
Yes: if you are 13 years old - I'm not joking: this is ideal for interested teenagers.
No: if you have a university degree. 

This podcast is violently dumbed-down to a high-school level, lots of little dramatizations. There are other things to be said about this. One is: the subjects are very interesting. Not only these people but other podcast makers too could make twin podcasts on the same subject. One 'entry level', easy listening; the other packed with information.

- Caravan To Midnight	NO

a radio show, with very very bad rambling. Even the most interesting subjects (Jimm Marrs) is almost unlistenable. Aka "Coast to Coast" ? 

- Coast to Coast	NO or MAYBE

a radio show, with very very bad rambling. Even the most interesting subjects (Jimm Marrs) is almost unlistenable. Later, I listened to another episode and it was much better: focused, professional. 

- Ottoman history 	YES

Of course. Exquisitly done, a lesson to others...even when it is (occassionally) boring. Still: this is how podcasts should be done. 

- StarTalk Radio Show with Neil deGrasse Tyson	NO

Terrible, terrible intervewer. All-round bad. He tries to be the interviewees' friend, no preparation, no insight, no confrontation and just all-round no-discipline.  Ruins it. 

- Turkey Booktalk Podcast	MAYBE

Would be very interesting, but the sound is TERRIBLE. It's been recorded on an iPhone ear-bud earphone phone mic (or worse). How could the sound be sooo bad? However, I listened to 3 or 4, and they were each extemely interesting. 

- The world next week	MAYBE

Openly put out by the CFR. Some good insights and actually criticizes, lightly, a CFR friend (the Australian government). Opinion rather that fact-based but I tended to agree, even when being confronted with (what I would have thought was) unacceptable statements. II remember a few face-palms, media-ready blinkers-on claims. However, ok. Like reading The Economist. 

Summary: rather than deep insight, this is more like "better journalism". 


- security now	NO

A couple of radio hosts with a lot of 'you knows' and 'oh, ha ha ha'. No subject-specific experts so only a general level of information. Waaaaay to much waffle, Waaaaay to long to explain simple things. It (should) take(s) one sentence to explain what glibc is. Not 7 minutes. Also, have to skip adverts

- Unsupervised Learning (new) / Take One security	MAYBE

Week presentation, sniffing, slow speaking, a few 'ummms' and "ah... let's see, ah..."  To much space. It's kinda disgusting to have someone sniffling in your earphones, in your ears. Good content, terrible presentation. I hvve come round to it, as the content is so excellent. 

- Open Society Foundation	NO

Very interesting, very deep and fundamental (e.g. Putin's propaganda advisor talking about his work), but not really interesting to listen to.  Just a room recording of public talks. 

- Analytical Impressions	NO

Pop-indie music podcast: bad interviewing, weak, unfocused questions often ignored by the interviewees. Like a radio show, pretty much. He doesn't even get the interviewee's names right, and one show comes with a "Lots of rambling" warning. 

- Diplomat Podcast 	MAYBE

interesting but these are children really. Repeated some stupidity. Worthy subjects, but these are probably employees of some US govt TLAs padding their resumes. 

- no agenda 	NO, RECENT ONLY, MAYBE

first thing: these are three (3) hours long, waaaay too long. Each could have been compressed into a good 1hour podcast. Too slow, and a radio show, so drags a bit. However, is at times laugh out loud funny, and has some excellent bits.  Behind the scenes to the trashy USA's trasy government. If they re-thought this a bit, and compressed each 3 hour show to 1 hour, then this podcast could be one of the greats. 

- saker 	NO

vague, wandering, "oh I'm doing this"  "these are just my ideas" ....
unfortunately, there are interesting and deep things here, just really badly done. He is GREAT in print tho, holy fuck. A missed oppourtunity as a podcast. 


- on being 	NO

great subjects; painfully, painfully vacuous speakers: "oh, I know Julie, yes <giggles> that's in my dream-dairy too, yes, hmmm". Oh my fucking god!  AVOID!



- guns and butter 	YES

good, interesting, serious, important, brave, clear, very well done. There's also a  vast archive covering every interesting subject. This is one of the greats. 

- hacker radio 	CHOOSE BEST

some good, some bad. Amatuer, so very varied in quality, even if interesting. Here, just choose the good subjects, and then do a subset from there. 

- unwelcome guests 	YES

serious, worthy. 

- piper Repub BroadCast NW	NO

radio and adverts and waffle: too much
interesting, radio (so waffle), but good subjects (FBI murdering Lennon)

- Tom Segura 	NO

a stupid fucking radio show comprised of waffle and adverts and banter and "well, that's great Tom". Avoid. 

- radio who, what, why 	YES

alternative politics, serious, worthy, dense

- techno-scheptic	YES

yes, worthy, serious

- Colbert report	YES

serious subjects, conspiracy study. More professional than (what's left of) the advertising-funded news media. There are some 'stand-up' comedy sessions that don't really work. 

- Freakonomics	MAYBE

well done, the one generalist magazine podcast that is acutally worth listening to.  Only tangentially related to economics. However.... it has too many adverts - we don't see adds any more, and here are 6, or more? WTF? 

- Black op radio	YES

Serious investigation, knowledgable hosts. Just all-round well done. 

- In our time (Oxford Uni)	YES

These are great, exquisityly knowledgeable people talking about all kinds of interesting things (choose the interesting ones, of course)

- Oxford Uni Physics	NO

Interesting, but really the audio from a video. Need to properly *study* the *video* to make it satisfactory. Doesn't work as audio only

- Oxford sparks	YES

Short, super interesting, experts, focused, well made

- Lost Origions	MAYBE

Very interesting, thouroughly exotic subjects and well done too. With experts. I am not sure why I am not taken with this. 

- My Kiwi Life	NO

So fucking lame. Takes about 5 minutes to start, 5 minutes of "well, you know, It's so.... I'm just a sensitive guy..." Why does anyone listen to this (apparently very popular) podcast? And the rest is not much better. Avoid. 

- Hacked	NO

They mean well, but there is not enough expertise. They feel that having a nice discussion is all that's needed. They need a different expert each week talking about their (the expert's) specialist field, with a few slowballs and frisbees thown in by the hosts. Good production, bad podcast. 



- Hack to Start	YES

Fantastic podcast. Each one is someone talking about how they started a successful tech/new media product or service, incl funding and everything. There is a lesson in this show. And it's award-winning, for good reason. To make a good podcast, copy Hack To Start. 



- NZ Tech Podcast	NO

Just not good enough. Not enough expertise - the hosts don't talk about thier fields of expertise - and just a re-hash of the week's tech news. I also feel that they are somehow insecure, but they have experts on, so I don't know. The problem is, again, that they are not talking to their expertise, but instaed to their gossip and hear-say collections. Broken by design.
